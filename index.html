     It seems like yesterday when I was playing PUBG and got randomly allotted in the same squad as yours, we became friends and started playing occasionally together. Our friendship has come a veryy long way since then. I never ever thought I'll have a bond sooo strong with someone I met online. The growth of our friendship was really exponential. People talk for years, still don't have proper chemistry but with you I felt an instant connection. You'd understand me even when I wasn't able to express myself properly. You're my safe space, I can speak anything in front of you without having the fear of being judged. We have sooo many things in common from TV shows to movies to views about things and sense of humor which makes me say we are same soul in different bodies. Uk how at the starting of any relationship, things are exciting and it deteriorates but with you that phase seems to be unending, you're like a really interesting Novel which never ends, no matter how much you read it just leaves you wanting for more (remember once I used the foreplay analogy in texts and said I will find something better, this is it loll) plus I swear I feel more close to you with every passing day.

     We started off with sharing texts, then memes then sharing our feelings, went from playing PUBG together to sketching and writing together. Our bond is extremely special, unique in its own way and truly irreplaceable. You are always there for me when my spirits need a lift. It's fascinating how unaware we were of each other's existence and now you're the person whose texts make me excited like a little child. This quarantine really sucks, but your presence really made it bearable (I kinda like it now because we would not get soo much time to play PUBG together when university starts). I seriously don't know how I would've handled it without you. I wish everyday that this quarantine and corona shit ends soon but one things scares me that you'll get busy, stop texting and we'll drift apart and then I will send you songs like Now you are just somebody that I used to know XD...haha maybe I'm overthinking. Everything around me can change but I know that you'll be my constant.

     I know I am not as good as you at expressing myself using words but I hope this gave you a little idea that how much you mean to me. You are truly a gem and finding you has really made me believe in Karma (I must have done something really good). You're the most kindest and adorable person I've come across. You have my unconditional love, no matter what happens I'll always be your bestfriend and just one text away. I loveee youuu....
